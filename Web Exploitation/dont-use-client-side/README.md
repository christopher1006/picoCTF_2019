## Hint
  > Never trust the client
## Solution
 Inspect the source code of the linked webpage. There is a javascript function that verifies the password in a chain of substring checks. However, it's not quite in order. Reorder the checked strings by looking at what `split` is multiplied by. e.g. `0, split` would be follow by `split, split*2` which would be follow by `split*2, split*3` and so on.
