# Insp3ct0r

## Points: 50

## Question 
  > Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/61676/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:61676
## Hint
  > How do you inspect web code on a browser?
  
  > There's 3 parts
## Solution
  The flag is in 3 sections. The first part is found by inspectin the code and looking in the body for notes. `picoCTF{tru3_d3`.
  The second and third parts are in the source files. "mycss.css" has 2/3 `with t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t`
  The third part is in "myjs.js" with ` _lucky?1638dbe7}`
### Flag
`picoCTF{picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?1638dbe7}`
