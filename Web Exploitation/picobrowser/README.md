## Question 
  >  This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21851/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21851
## Hint
  > You dont need to download a new web browser
## Solution
 My first thought is checking Robots.txt to see if there's any exclusions but nothing's there. Checking the source code of the page lends nothing either. At this point I figured that this challenge is a slightly different flavor of the time manipulation one just before this. After browsing around for info about user agents and how to change them, this howtogeek article gives a very simple method. The short of it is that you can change your user agent value to `picobrowser` via an override function. `https://www.howtogeek.com/113439/how-to-change-your-browsers-user-agent-without-installing-any-extensions/`
