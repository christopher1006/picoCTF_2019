# Open-to-admins

## Points: 200

## Question 
  > This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37878/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:37878
## Hint
  > Can cookies help you to get the flag?
## Solution
 The key to this challenge is understanding where the two criteria values reside in the web page. The first, admin, is referencing a boolean variable called `admin` that is a separate cookie to be edited and we can see it's already set to True. The second, `time` is a little trickier. `time` is attached to `document` and can be accessed in the console with `document.cookie="time=xxx"`. Change the xxx to 1400, submit it, and refresh the page to get the flag.
