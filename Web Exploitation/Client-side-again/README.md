## Hint
  > What is obfuscation?
## Solution
 Either manually deobfuscate or go to wwwjsnice.org and plug in the Javascript for easier to read formatting. You can either try and figure out where all those different checks go or realize that the answer is in the array. We know `picoCTF{` must be the beginning because f the rules of the challenge. `not_this` follows due to it being part of the check `if(checkpass['substring'](0x6,0xb)=='F{not'`. Since the only remaining likely possibilites are `this`, `_again_b`, and `25df2}`, we have something to work with. Now, `25df2}` must be the final item due to the ending curly brace. It might seem like there are 5 elements we should incorporate into the flag but there's a little more to this. The final call checks string positions 12 to 16, something that had already been previously checked in an 8 to 16 position check. So which to pick? Heck if I know, just plug them both in at this point since we know exactly where the last element will be. So try `picoCTF{not_this_this25df2}` and `picoCTF{not_this_again_b25df2}` in the site password checker to see which one is correct. 
### Flag
`picoCTF{not_this_again_b25df2}`
