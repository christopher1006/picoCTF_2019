# logon

## Points: 100

## Question 
  > The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47307/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:47307
## Hint
  > Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for {{name}}'s?
## Solution
 Inspecting the page does not reveal anything immediately helpful. You can login with any username and password, including just not inputting anything at all. When logged in, I used the Cookie Editor extension for Firefox to see a variable called `admin` set to `False`. Change this to `True`, save and you should get the flag to display.
