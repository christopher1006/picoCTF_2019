# where are the robots

## Points: 100

## Question 
  > Can you find the robots? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:4159
## Hint
  > What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?
## Solution
 The hint is in the question. Robots is a reference to a file called robots.txt. This file is found on websites that want a web crawler to avoid scanning certain parts of their site. Start by appending `robots.txt` to the end of the link URL. The file itself only has a single exclusion, `/a44f7.html`. Go to `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/a44f7.html` and you will see the flag.
